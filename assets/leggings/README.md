The 3d model license of turbosquid prohibits the redistribution of models!

If you want to reproduce what can be seen on the preview, please go to [turbosquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-spaceship-ship-space-model/408426)    
and download the model

These files need to exist in this folder:

- Spaceship.obj
- Spaceship.mtl
- SpaceShipSpecular.png
- SpaceShipUV.png

**You must download the blender version, as the obj version does not have the textures. Using blender, you need to export it in the obj format!**

**Make sure you convert the jpg files to png (raylib seems to have an issue loading jpg files, did not dig deep enough to resolve it!) and adjust the .mtl file to use the png version instead of jpg!**

Every other file is not needed!
